The solution foamed upon the sodium hydride addition. The resulting dark orange solution was stirred, at 0Â° C., for 30 minutes upon completion of sodium hydride addition. The reaction solution became viscous and additional DMF (5 mL) was added, via syringe, the ice bath removed and the dark solution stirred at room temperature, under nitrogen, for 2 h. The reaction was cooled in an ice bath, quenched with 0.1N hydrochloric acid solution, and transferred to a separatory funnel with ethyl acetate (100 mL). This organic phase was washed with brine (75 mLÃ3). The aqueous washings were combined and extracted with ethyl acetate (75 mLÃ3). The organic extracts were combined and washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (100 mL), brine (100 mL), dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and the solvent removed to give an amber colored oil (2.21 g). This oil was adsorbed onto silica and purified by column chromatography, eluting with 50% ethyl acetate in hexane to afford the product as a light yellow colored solid (1.37 g, 92%).

      "The 2-[1-(1-benzyloxycarbonylpiperidin-3-yl)-ethylamino]-4-[benzimidazol-1-yl]pyrimidine (900 mg, 1.97 mmol) was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (25 mL), and the mixture was cooled down to 0Â° C. To this was added 30% HBr in acetic acid (5 mL) slowly and continued stirring at 0Â° C. for 15 min The bath was removed, and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 45 min and then was diluted with H2O (25 mL). The reaction mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2 (2Ã20 mL; discarded), then the aqueous layer was made neutral with 5N NaOH and extracted with EtOAc (3Ã25 mL; discarded). The aqueous layer was made strongly basic (>pH 12) with SN NaOH, and was extracted with EtOAc (4Ã30 mL). The combined extracts were washed with brine and dried over Na2SO4. After removal of solvent under reduced pressure, 543 mg of the title compound was obtained which was used without purification.
